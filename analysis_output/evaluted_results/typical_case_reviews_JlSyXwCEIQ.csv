JlSyXwCEIQ,original,CodeIt: Abstract Reasoning with Iterative Policy-Guided Program Synthesis [original],4.5,Reject,"The paper presents CodeIt, an iterative program synthesis approach to solve the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark. The method iterates between sampling programs from a language model policy and learning the policy using supervised learning. The sampling stage uses hindsight relabeling and program mutation to augment the programs. The method is evaluated on the ARC benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The paper received four reviews, all of which rated the paper as marginally below the acceptance threshold. The reviewers raised several concerns, including the limited novelty of the method, the lack of evaluation on other benchmarks, and the absence of discussion on limitations. The authors provided a response to the reviews, but unfortunately, the reviewers did not update their scores.

JlSyXwCEIQ,no_conclusion,CodeIt: Abstract Reasoning with Iterative Policy-Guided Program Synthesis [no_conclusion],5.0,Reject,"This paper proposes a program synthesis approach to solve the ARC benchmark. The approach iterates between sampling from the current large language model policy and learning that policy using supervised learning. The sampling stage augments newfound programs using hindsight relabeling and program mutation, requiring no expert search procedure. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the ARC benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Strengths: The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The proposed method is well-motivated and easy to understand. The empirical results are promising, with the proposed method achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ARC benchmark. The proposed method is simple yet effective. The proposed method is easy to implement and does not require any expert search procedure, making it a practical approach for solving the ARC benchmark. The paper provides a comprehensive review of the related work and compares the proposed method with several state-of-the-art approaches on the ARC benchmark.

Weaknesses: The proposed method is not scalable. The method requires a large number of programs to be sampled and stored in the buffer, which makes it difficult to apply to large-scale problems. The method relies on a pre-trained language model, which is not always available. The method is not generalizable. The method is designed specifically for the ARC benchmark and may not work for other problems.
